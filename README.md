### NodeChain - A very basic blockchain implementation in NodeJS

In my attempt to firmly grasp blockchain technology, I am attempting to build a very simple blockchain following a tutorial by [Darren Beck](www.darrenbeck.co.uk/blockchain/nodejs/nodejscrypto)

In the next few weeks, I will be pushing out some more repos, and will hopefully strengthen my grip over the nitty gritty details pertaining to blockchain tech.
